How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves understanding the goals, challenges, and contexts of your users. This process starts with active listening and empathy to gather 
accurate and comprehensive requirements. Creating "user stories" is a very important step in this process, as it helps break down complex user needs into manageable, specific tasks that focus on the value 
delivered to the user. User stories make it easier to prioritize features, plan iterations, and ensure that development efforts are aligned with user expectations, leading to more effective and user-centered
solutions.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approaching program development typically involves a blend of planning, iteration, and reflection. Incorporating agile processes into future development work means embracing principles like continuous
delivery, adaptive planning, early delivery, and continual improvement. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, encourage flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback throughout the development
process. This approach allows for rapid response to change, encourages iterative progress, and helps ensure that the final product meets user needs effectively.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves clear communication, collaboration, respect for diverse perspectives, and a willingness to give and receive constructive feedback. Good team
members are reliable, actively contribute to problem-solving, and support their teammates' growth and success. They are open to learning from others, share knowledge generously, and help create an inclusive
and positive team environment. Embracing these qualities fosters teamwork and leads to the successful completion of projects.
